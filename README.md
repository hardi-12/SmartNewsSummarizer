# Smart News Summarizer

## Introduction
We tend to read multiple news articles on a daily basis but a certain news topic may not contain 
all the relevant information. We can have an insightful information out of the comprehensive 
articles that will help us save a lot of time and energy. Text summarization is a way of minimizing 
a textual document to a meaningful summary by preserving its information content and the overall 
meaning. Here an extractive based multi-document summary is presented to summarize news 
articles from different news sites which describe about the same topic. This will help us enhance 
the readability of a particular news article without missing any important points. The first-level 
summary generates the summary of each article on the topics. Sentiment Analysis is performed on 
the first-level summary to understand the variation in related news articles. The second level 
summary generates the summary of the combined first-level summaries of two or more related 
articles on a topic. The situation is even worse for the people who are visually impaired or have 
lost their ability to see. The inability of these people to read text has a huge impact on their lives. 
There are a number of methods for blind people to read text. So, we present a method for visually 
impaired people based on the sense of sound which is obviously better and more accurate than the 
sense of touch. We can have an insightful information out of the comprehensive articles that will 
help us save a lot of time and energy.
